# Model-invoked vs user-invoked

Every `SKILL.md` in this repo is a skill. The one axis that splits them is **invocation**, who can reach it:

- **User-invoked**: reachable **only by the human typing its name**. Set `disable-model-invocation: true` in the frontmatter (Claude Code) and `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml` (Codex). The `description` remains agent-facing, but the harness excludes it from the model's ordinary context. Keep it to a concise statement of the invoked job; it does not need automatic-selection trigger branches.
- **Model-invoked**: reachable by **model or user**. The default: omit `disable-model-invocation` and the `policy` block from `agents/openai.yaml`. The `description` is **model-facing** and keeps rich trigger phrasing ("Use when the user wants…, mentions…, asks for…") so auto-invocation fires. The test for whether a skill should stay model-invoked: _could the model usefully reach for this autonomously?_ (Reuse is the reason to extract a skill, not the test.)

Each harness excludes a user-invoked skill from the model's reach in its own way, so nothing but the human can fire it: no other skill can. A user-invoked skill may invoke model-invoked skills, but it can never reach another user-invoked skill.

Every skill also carries an `agents/openai.yaml` beside its `SKILL.md`. It holds Codex UI metadata: `interface.display_name` and `interface.short_description` for the skill picker, and, for user-invoked skills, the `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` that pairs with `disable-model-invocation`. Keep the two in sync: a skill is user-invoked in both harnesses or neither.

Bucket `README.md`s and the top-level `README.md` group entries into **User-invoked** and **Model-invoked**.

## Dependencies between them

Dependencies are expressed as an explicit instruction to **apply the named skill** (`Apply the "grilling" skill to the user's subject`), not deep `../other-skill/FILE.md` cross-references and not a bare `/skill`-style mention. Each harness loads a skill through its own mechanism, so the instruction names the capability rather than prescribing a tool API that may not exist. Shared reference docs live inside the skill that owns them; other skills reach that material by applying the owning skill, not by linking across folders.

This is about **operative** instructions: a skill's own steps telling the agent to go run another skill right now. Router prose that just names skills for a human to pick from (`ask-matt`, bucket `README.md`s) isn't invoking anything, so it keeps `/skill`-style names as plain labels.

A step that needs two skills applies each one separately. State which job each skill performs instead of treating several names as one combined invocation.

This whole convention only holds when the named skill is **model-invoked**. A user-invoked skill can never be reached this way. When a step's precondition is a user-invoked skill (for example `setup-matt-pocock-skills`), tell the user to run it rather than trying to apply it from another skill.

## Passive vs active domain work

Merely _reading_ `CONTEXT.md` for vocabulary is a one-line prose pointer, not the `domain-modeling` skill. Only the active build/sharpen discipline (challenge terms, edge-case scenarios, write ADRs, update `CONTEXT.md` inline) is `domain-modeling`.
